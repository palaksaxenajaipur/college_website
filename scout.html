  <h2>About Scout & Guide</h2>
  <p>
    Scouts and Guides are global youth organizations aiming to develop young people’s character, leadership skills, and citizenship through outdoor activities, community service, and education. Founded by Robert Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell in the early 20th century, Scouts and Guides have grown into one of the world’s largest and most influential youth movements. Members, known as Scouts or Guides, participate in various activities such as camping, hiking, first aid training, and environmental conservation projects. These organizations promote values such as teamwork, self-reliance, respect for others, and stewardship of the environment. Scouts and Guides provide young people with opportunities to learn, grow, and make positive contributions to their communities, fostering a sense of belonging and responsibility that lasts a lifetime.  </p>
